Designed multi-page dashboards: Monthly View, Consolidated View, Patient Details, and Key Insights, enabling deep exploration of ER performance.

Visualized key metrics such as patient inflow patterns, peak busy hours, gender & race distribution, age group segmentation, and referral patterns.


Identified operational bottlenecks by analyzing peak ER hours (11 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, 11 PM) and busiest days (Monday & Saturday), suggesting staffing optimization.

Highlighted patient experience insights: 35.3 min average wait time and moderate satisfaction score (4.99/10) to support service improvement strategies.
